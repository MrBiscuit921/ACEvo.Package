# ACEvo.Package

KSPackage archive tool for Assetto Corsa EVO.

NOTE: **Absolutely no support will be provided.** I don't normally deal with racing games at all anymore but this didn't take more than 2 hours.

## Side Notes

The majority of the game content/files uses [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) schemas which may need to be reversed.

## Modding

It is supposedly possible to dump the game contents to the root of the game and renaming `content.kspkg` so that the game doesn't read it, so that the game can run unpacked.

## Building

.NET 9.0 and Visual Studio 2022.

Contributions are welcome.
